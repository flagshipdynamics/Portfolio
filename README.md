CommodityFlowInsights.ipynb
Project: Commodity Flow Survey Insights
This is a modified notebook based on a Udacity clustering / PCA project. I'm modifying it to be more of a 'deliverable' for analysis of other datasets.

The dataset used is from data.gov under same name as the project.

CommodityFlowInsightsLITE.ipynb
Lite version of above, more suitable for final deliverable. Specifically removes visualizations and review of data prior to Feature Scaling.
